### Assumptions
1) Doctor Relevancy:

I assumed that the top three most relevant doctors where already computed with respect to specialty and location for each doctor in the db.



### Thoughts Going Forward:
  Lots of styling still needs to be done including but not limited to:
   - transition animations between up arrow and down arrows
   - transition animations for shrinking and expanding doctor info
   - better color scheme
   - using shadow to deliniate where on doctor starts and other ends
